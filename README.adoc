An example project that demonstrates the use of the Asciidoctor Gradle Plugin.
The project also includes an example of an Asciidoctor extension written in _Groovy_.

== How to build the project

 $ gradle asciidoctor

That's it.
Seriously.

NOTE: Move buildSrc to buildSrc~ to try without loading the Asciidoctor extensions.
